## Testing Strategy
- This is just a demo application for a presentation - don't bother writing tests

## Development Tools
- Use Laravel Pint for PHP code formatting
- Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Configure proper IDE settings for the team
- Use Git hooks for code quality checks

## Local Development
- Set up proper database migrations
- Configure local environment variables
- Use Laravel's built-in development server
- Set up proper debugging tools (Xdebug, etc.)

## Deployment Considerations
- Use proper environment variable management
- Configure proper logging for production
- Set up monitoring and alerting
